# Data_Analysis_Project
## This project includes bike sharing system data analysis and DVD rental customer data analysis.
### In the bike sharing system data analysis, the main tasks are
#### •	Load, clean and prepare data for analysis and visualization

#### •	Implement exploratory data analysis (EDA) and explore data to find interesting patterns

#### •	perform detailed analysis and hypothesis test to determine factors that affect rental bikes significantly

#### •	Implement linear regression model and select best model to predict the growth of sales for the next few years


### In the DVD rental customer data analysis, the main tasks are
#### •	Write complex SQL queries to get the required data from database

#### •	Implement unsupervised learning algorithm (k-means clustering) to cluster customers into four distinct groups and visualize the result

#### •	Implement K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) and fine-tuning hyperparameter that maximize the classification performance with 83% accuracy

#### •	Perform independent test and design statistical metrics that improve the stability of result
